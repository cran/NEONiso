Description: Functions for downloading,
    calibrating, and analyzing atmospheric isotope data bundled
    into the eddy covariance data products of the National Ecological
    Observatory Network (NEON) <https://www.neonscience.org>. 
    In this version, calibration tools are provided for only the 
    carbon isotope products. Tools for calibrating water isotope 
    products are under development. More details are found in Fiorella et al. (2021)
