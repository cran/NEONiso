# NEONiso 0.5.0

* Adds the calibrate_carbon() function, which can be used to generate
monthly output files or can be used to bundle all of the months of data
available for an individual site into a single file. In the long-term,
calibrate_carbon() will be the 'workhorse' function for NEON's carbon data,
and calibrate_carbon_bymonth will be deprecated in a future release.

# NEONiso 0.4.0

* This is the initial release on CRAN.
